## 🧑‍💻 About Me  
12 years of battle-hardened experience in software development, system architecture, and cloud computing. If there’s a bug, I find it. If there’s a bottleneck, I crush it. If there’s an unnecessary meeting, I avoid it.  

Specialties:  
- Writing **.NET Core magic**  
- Speaking fluent **Docker & Kubernetes**  
- Arguing with **AWS & Azure**  
- Deploying things that *hopefully don’t crash at 2 AM*  

I'm a mentor, problem-solver, and the person you call when your production server starts speaking in error codes.

I once deployed a critical fix in production at 3 AM while half-asleep… and it worked. First try.
